While the intent of this document is to show only a couple of mods for Fabric to join LoganDark, there are other mods for Fabric that can help to make the experience on _any_ server that much better and this is effectively a compilation of mods I find useful.  
  
**Required**  
> _[Fabric API]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)  
Part of the Fabric toolchain and an essential jar to get!  

**Server-specific**  
> _[Immersive Portals]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod)  
An addon that allows for the creation of instantaneous point-to-point connections between two points in space in _any_ dimension — even third-party dimensions! This can also allow for world looping and dimension stacking for interesting long-play sessions of modded Minecraft or world boundaries which loop over the world, thus eschewing the need for a world border when the border could just be a seamless loop to another point in space.  

> _[Pehkui]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui)  
Entity scaling API for most mobs — Renders the giant zombie obsolete when you could have giant _anything_, or entities can be really, really small. Jumping physics and hitboxes also scale with size, so the bigger you are, the higher your jump in comparison to smaller entities. At a certain size you could also be _too_ small to clear half-block altitude changes without jumping, or worse — be unable to clear one-block jumps.  

**Universal**  
> _[Mod Menu]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)  
An interface to view installed mods and libraries. Also allows for accessing settings for mods which have Mod Menu support!  
_[Bedrockify]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bedrockify)  

> Bedrock features in Java Minecraft! Be able to see enchants on selected item in hotbar, see your avatar in the upper left, have a saving indicator, use Bedrock recipes in single-player, build in mid-air with reach-around block placement, reposition multiplayer chat, see your FPS and more!  

> _[RPG-HUD]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rpg-hud-fabric/)  
See more stats, and make said information be presented in a way similar to RPG games! Comes with several interface options to choose from, and whatever interface is used can also have placement of screen objects repositioned. Also, be able to stare infinitely in space to any entity and see the stats of whatever's in your crosshair!  

**Graphics**
> _[OptiFabric]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric)  
A bridge for OptiFine in Fabric. If you have this, you can use OptiFine!  

> _[Sodium]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabricThe open-source, lighter-weight alternative of OptiFine. It lacks features in comparison to OptiFine, to if you use Sotium instead of OptiFine + OptiFabric, read below!  

**Extras for Sodium**
> _[Item model fix]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/item-model-fix)  
Fixes 3D object stitching to improve the appearance of objects in-game.  

> _[Phosphor]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor)  
Improved light rendering for Minecraft! Made by the same author as Sodium, it can help to improve game performance for both servers and clients so the game becomes less hung up on illuminating the world.

> _[LambDynamicLights]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdynamiclights)  
Adds dynamic lighting into Minecraft! Also has water sensitivity check for making it impossible to use torches underwater, should you want that.   

> _[LambdaBetterGrass]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdabettergrass)  
One lamb's dream to have better grass than MCPatcher and OptiFine.   

> _[Ok Zoomer]_(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ok-zoomer)  
The ultimate zoom mod for Minecraft. Accept no substitutes!
