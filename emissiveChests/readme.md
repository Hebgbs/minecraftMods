# See your chests!
This is a very simple mod — Make the locks of chests appear fully illuminated even in complete darkness to see your chests.

# Compatibility
I venture to create _new_ works concurrently _as emissive resource packs exist for them._ This means if there isn't an emissives pack — first-party or fan-made — there won't be a pack here. So this means the available packs as follows _based on my knowledge_ are:

|Pack|Size|Description|Download|
|---|---|---|---|
|Default|16x|The classic Minecraft texture pack we all know and love|[Click](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/emissiveChests/Default_eChests)|
|[Stay True](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/stay-true-4447380/)|16x|A visual remastering of the default game textures using more vibrant colours and deeper faux-reliefs.|[Click](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/emissiveChests/StayTrue_eChests)|
