# Immersive Subtitles
> Presently, I am open to `pack.png` submissions! Feel free to also push changes with modified pack thumbnails to evaluate, or leave a comment with your submission!

This is the alternative repository and primary development portal for Immersive Subtitles, a Minecraft mod to make subtitles _not suck_ usng colours and formatting.  

If you would like to suggest improvements, please file issues with your request. **do not** fork and push changes to default expecting me to implement unless it is to present ways of miniaturizing code in the provided `json` file by removing redundant formatting characters.  

This kit **does not** cover snapshot and supported mods are severely limited at the moment. More may come later. Deliberation on colours and formatting used are welcome, and necessary to improve this modification so subtitles _by appearance_ are more intuitive to understand for sighted individuals with only minor sensory defects who possess a common understanding of qualia for colour. For major sensory defects like colourblindness (any of the three major types), additional third-party mods which address such with shaders / filters may be necessary.
  
Feel free to let me know on PMC how this mod tastes. I'd be interested in knowing!

### Saving this content
Please visit the [guide to saving my resource packs](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/blob/master/howToSave.md) for this information.
  
### Subs from other mods
So far, only Presence Footsteps and (1.17.1) Dynamic Surroundings are supported. You can help to change this.

### Translations  
TBD. Make an issue if you believe I should give a hoot about your tongue enough to spend another three hours combing through my changes and creating additional translations. As triggers should be common between languages (I would hope) it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. If you want to save me some effort, make a pull request with your mother tongue receiving the same treatment as this mod and I will consider merging your work here.

### Other changes  
`subtitles.block.respawn_anchor.ambient` had its output changed to reflect it is sound emitted from a Respawn Anchor.  
  
`subtitles.entity.fishing_bobber.splash` has its output changed to be more direct about something on the line.  
  
Wherever there were matching subtitles for different triggers, they are colourized to reflect a diffferent state,  
  
"Show Subtitles" in a11y settings is multcoloured. You can't miss it.

### Formatting index
To view available subtitles and their colours, visit [this Google Sheets page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aPCZAgUGpQImp0_3_iA5Hmn1qqhBic0NFWg37GEwZZM/edit?usp=sharing). It's the only way I could comprehensively index using colour and formatting without enduring the **eternal hell** of a table with 600+ rows.  
  
This is subject to change as people request. If you would like to mae your own personal changes, copy whatever triggers and outputs you wish to use and create your own resource pack to supersede changes this provides.
