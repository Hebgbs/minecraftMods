# Emissives for HellPortals
> _This only works with OptiFine! If using Sodium, sorry about that!_

This directory is for HellPortal emissives, whenever they are applicable. For now, it is _only_ the default but this will be modified over time as more packs use this feature, or there are other third-party contributions using emissives in this exact configuration.

# `_e`
Why `_e`? Because this suffix is what OptiFine uses for emissive textures _by default._ This can be changed by end-users or modpacks, but generally most people will use the default emissives suffix.

# Compatibility
The following _emissive addons_ are available for everyone to download and add to their game profile's `resourcepacks` directory:
|Pack|Size|Description|Download|
|---|---|---|---|

## Load order
Emissives are handled in their own separate pack. Placement order **must** be as shown:
   1. `$_HellPortals_e`
   2. `$_HellPortals`
   3. `$`
> _**$**: The name or local alias of the original pack being modified. ex. Default for Minecraft's default textures.
