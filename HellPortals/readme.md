# Remember where to enter!
The door to **Hell** is **amber!** Inspired from King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard's final song from Infest the Rats Nest — _Hell_ — these resource packs based from other existing works are recoloured to be more amber-like in appearance, and wherever applicable with other changes to make the orange-brown hue of portals, crying obsidian, respawn anchors in in some instances Obsidian pop with subtle shades of blue and purple.

# Compatibility
The following is available for everyone to download and add to their game profile's `resourcepacks` directory:
|Pack|Description|
|---|---|
|Minecraft|The classic texture pack we all know and love|
|[Quadral](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/ignafs-quadral-resourcepack/)|Winner of Planet Minecraft's Simplepack Showdown 2, with textures which are simple, flat and vibrant.|

# Installation
[View this guide](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/blob/master/howToSave.md) for more information.

However you go about installing it, place this _above_ your preferred texture pack so changes are applied.

# Disclaimer
I do not own any of the original works these are derived from. This repository is not endorsed by any resource pack creator whose works are derived from. You use this work provided _as-is_ with no express guarantee of function or compatibility, so on, so forth, blah blah blah.

Basically you're on your own and no resource pack author of derivative works has any obligation to assist you with this kit.
