# Remember where to enter!
The door to **Hell** is **amber!** Inspired from King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard's final song from Infest the Rats Nest — _Hell_ — these resource packs based from other existing works are recoloured to be more amber-like in appearance, and wherever applicable with other changes to make the orange-brown hue of portals, crying obsidian, respawn anchors in in some instances Obsidian pop with subtle shades of blue and purple.
