# InventorySense Transparent UI
Heightened situational awareness via a remix of InventorySense UI you can see through.

> This work is based on 1.4.2. As this is an unaffiliated work, any specific 1.4.3 changes _may_ be reverted, though they are not likely significant enough to be of notice as the author mentioned most of the changes were not noteworthy. Nonetheless, raise an issue if something is inconsistient compared to InventorySense UI 1.4.3.

### Downloads
Should you not want to download the entire Git repo for retrieving this theme, that is entrirely understandable. [Click on this link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/InvSenseRmx/TransparentUI/InvSenseUI_Transparent) to download the theme, courtesy of DownGit should you be unable or unwilling to do so from PlanetMinecraft.  
  
For other colours, companion themes _to be used with this one_ can be found in [colourRmx](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/InvSenseRmx/colourRmx). Make sure you download a choice of companion suffixed with `clr-` (clear) in the beginning â€” this shorthand was used instead of any variety for transparent which could lead to potential end-user misunderstanding.
  
**This is a replacement theme.** Do _not_ use with InventorySense UI!

### Interface principles
On top of principles defined by Moxwel, the _other_ following concept bible additions are included:  
**General**
* All corners are to be the same no matter what.
  
**Transparent UI**
* All _buttons_ are to remain opaque as they do not interfere with visibility behind menus enough to warrant the extra effort.
* All tab images are to be styled in a way which make them seamlessly blend into the transparent interface.
* All secondary interface elements (simulated speech bubbles, grids, so-on) use dithering to simulate transparency.
* All player interface icons which are _not_ the Hotbar or inventory slots use dithering as well.
* Potion effect background interface elements are dithered as well.
* All text input boxes remain untouched, no matter what.
* If I couldn't figure out what to use, take inspiration and barrow from VanllaTweaks' Transparent UI.
* Invert any elements which could be brighter, or are pure black _which isn't a text box or player inventory_ for visibility.
* Keep shadows consistient, and improve upon both InventorySense and Transparent UI concepts.

These changes ensure that there are not any awkward inconsistiencies between interfaces, while hybridizing Transparent UI concepts provided by VanillaTweaks effectively.

### Supported languages
**All of them.** Thanks to John Meow for that. Original language files were provided by VanillaTweaks for Transparent UI.
