### About
InventorySense UI by Moxwel is a very Bedrock-inspired theme which has added niceties like being able to see a _representation_ of what certain interaction blocks look like, distinction between spaces in player dialogues and OptiFine support to include certain additional elements specifc for each trade level and what kind of trade a villager has using additional iconography.  
  
This repository presents changes as I see fit, for a variety of purposes, as I please. Most of these changes will be based around VanillaTweaks modifications, the first of which will be for transparent UI.

### Interface principles
On top of principles defined by Moxwel, the _other_ following concept bible additions are included:  
**General**
* All corners are to be the same no matter what.
  
**Transparent UI**
* All _buttons_ are to remain opaque as they do not interfere with visibility behind menus enough to warrant the extra effort.
* All tab images are to be styled in a way which make them seamlessly blend into the transparent interface.
* All secondary interface elements (simulated speech bubbles, grids, so-on) use dithering to simulate transparency.
* All player interface icons which are _not_ the Hotbar or inventory slots use dithering as well.
* Potion effect background interface elements are dithered as well.
* All text input boxes remain untouched, no matter what.
* If I couldn't figure out what to use, take inspiration and barrow from VanllaTweaks' Transparent UI.
* Invert any elements which could be brighter, or are pure black _which isn't a text box or player inventory_ for visibility.
* Keep shadows consistient, and improve upon both InventorySense and Transparent UI concepts.

These changes ensure that there are not any awkward inconsistiencies between interfaces, while hybridizing Transparent UI concepts provided by VanillaTweaks effectively.

### Supported languages
**All of them.** Thanks to John Meow for that.
