# InventorySense Transparent UI recipe book grid
Recipe book transparency dithering for people who want to make recipies consistient with everything else in the Minecraft interface

> This original work is based on 1.4.2. As this is an unaffiliated work, any specific 1.4.3 changes _may_ be reverted, though they are not likely significant enough to be of notice as the author mentioned most of the changes were not noteworthy. Nonetheless, raise an issue if something is inconsistient compared to InventorySense UI 1.4.3.

### Load order
These themes are additive. They must be used _along with_ an existing theme. The example provided is for "Minecraft blue" InventorySense Transparent UI:  
> `InvSenseUI_clr-MCblue_bookGrid.zip`  
> `InvSenseUI_clr-MCblue.zip`  
> `InvSenseUI_Transparent.zip`  
  
For other colours, companion themes _to be used with this one_ can be found in [colourRmx](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/InvSenseRmx/colourRmx). Make sure you download a choice of companion suffixed with `clr` (clear) in the beginning â€” this shorthand was used instead of any variety for transparent which could lead to potential ebd-user misunderstanding.

This repository presents changes as I see fit, for a variety of purposes, as I please. Most of these changes will be based around VanillaTweaks modifications, the first of which will be for transparent UI.

### Interface principles
The recipe book in Minecraft is pretty blank-looking, so for people who want to fill that in they can use this style. The dithered appearance stil makes it see-through so you can see things ahead of you, only with less clarity.
