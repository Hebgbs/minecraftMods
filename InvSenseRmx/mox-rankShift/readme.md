# InventorySense UI Rank Shift
Recipe book transparency dithering for people who want to make recipies consistient with everything else in the Minecraft interface.

> This original work is based on 1.4.2. As this is an unaffiliated work, any specific 1.4.3 changes _may_ be reverted, though they are not likely significant enough to be of notice as the author mentioned most of the changes were not noteworthy. Nonetheless, raise an issue if something is inconsistient compared to InventorySense UI 1.4.3.

### Load order
These themes are additive. They must be used _along with_ an existing theme. The example provided is for "Minecraft blue" InventorySense Transparent UI:
> `InvSenseUI_mox-MCblue_rankshift.zip`  
> `InbSenseUI_mox-MCblue.zip`  
> `InventorySense UI 1.4.3.zip`  
  
For other colours, companion themes _to be used with this one_ can be found in [colourRmx](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/InvSenseRmx/colourRmx). Make sure you download a choice of companion suffixed with `mox-` (Moxwel) in the beginning â€” this shorthand represents the _original_ InventorySense UI mod.

### Interface principles
By default, InventorySense Transparent UI has a big ol' empty hole in the recipe book. Some may prefer this, others may prefer to fill the hole without necessarily compromising their vision.
  
This series of companion themes will match whatever selection from [colourRmx](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/InvSenseRmx/colourRmx) is used, _if applicable_ and adjust the recipe book so is uses dithered transparency as opacity simply doesn't work.
