# Terracotta from [Essense](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/essense-proof-of-concept/) texture pack
Since it seems like nothing else like this exists, figured I would re-upload this as its own separate texture pack for people to use alongside other, existing texture packs with emissive textures. This is _only_ for default Minecraft glazed terracotta, no other variants will be made.

# Give your diamonds!
While Devee might not even care about Planet Minecraft anymore, you should still give the original author diamonds for the effort. This pack is expressly for use with _other_ texture packs, and for an example of what it does, you should visit the original author's page for [Essense](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/essense-proof-of-concept/) and check it out.

If I end up finding other things from different resource packs, I might spin this into an emissives compilation. _For the time being_ this will only host emissive textures for glazed terracotta.

# Differences from original
All of the files needed to be renamed. That's about it.
