# _Oooh_ shiny!
Seamless animated shimmering blocks? Yes please! This resource pack provides — in no uncertain terms — one of the most complex "Vanilla" style mods ever conceived… at least by me, thus far.

Basing itself on Stridey's directional lodestone as a block which has separate textures for different faces, this takes that idea a step further by using _animated_ textures.

The animation begins in the northwest side and stops at the southeast side. It looks a little funny seeing it at odd angles, but generally it should look great when facing either north or west, and alright if facing south or east.

# Compatibility
### 3D ores
This work can be used with my other, previous work [Hebgbs' emissive ores remix](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/3DemissiveOres+VTredOff) if the content from `./3DOres` is copied into the resource pack and overridden. Consider it, if you want shiny-looking ores that are **both** 3D _and_ emissive!

Use with other texture packs? _Forget about it_ — for now! If there is interest in compatibility with other texture packs, let me know! I am sure there are "3D" ores for other texture packs I can spiff up and follow a similar theme. _Or you can do it yourself_ as this work also provides the debug images I used for the shimmer animation.

### Copper
Copper and Cut Copper blocks are available but not in the main pack due to difficulties making stairs work out. If you want these, you need to get them from `./cuMods` as while `./3DOres` and the base pack has animated ore, there's no blocks to be seen elsewhere.

### Installation
Just download the repository and place it to your profile's resource pack directory.

**For 3D ores** extract base first, then overwrite with content from [`./3DOres`](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/faux16%2032x%20%22Vanilla%22%20shiny%20minerals/3DOres). You'll definitely want to pair it with [this resource pack](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/3DemissiveOres+VTredOff), which can be used stand-alone.

**For copper blocks** _(excluded from base since I couldn't make the stairs work out)_ extract [`./cuMods`](https://github.com/Hebgbs/minecraftMods/tree/master/faux16%2032x%20%22Vanilla%22%20shiny%20minerals/cuMods) to base directory, so contents from `./assets` are merged together.
