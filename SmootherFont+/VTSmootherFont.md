# VT Smoother Font+
The contents provided here are  works originally published by Compliance team and had been provided to Vanilla Tweaks. These modified works are not affiliated with Vanilla Tweaks or Compliance team, nor is the author affiliated with either party.

## Rationale
The reason this font pack exists is because Compliance messed with Minecraft's font a _bit_ too much for my liking. There are a set of extended-like characters provided in Minecraft which are held separate and distinct from Latin alphabetical characters, that they decided wasn't right unless they replaced with their Latin equivalents. _I took that personally._

You see, I am passionate about writing. I want to ensure everybody's intent within Minecraft with their writ comes off as they expected, and those changes removed a form of expression with writs people took the time to create in editors like LingoJam's Fancy Text Generator. Not only that, they couldn't finish the job! Compliance's modifications forgot the letter I. Install Smoother Font from Vanilla Tweaks and test this:
> ᴛʜᴇʏ ꜰᴏʀɢᴏᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ "ɪ". ᴛʜɪꜱ ᴀʟꜱᴏ, ɪ ᴛᴏᴏᴋ ᴘᴇʀꜱᴏɴᴀʟʟʏ.

Resolution of these frustrations alone do not make up this pack, however:

### Other changes you probably will not notice
* Small cap Y has a slightly taller split.
* Every single capital A provided has extra pixels inside to round it out.
* The Q's have longer tails going inside, and are shaped slightly different from the letter O (as shown in `pack.png`).
* Small M and small W have taller middle stems to better distinguish them.
* That one instance the small number 6 has a extra pixel at its tail? Yeah, every 6 and 9 has that now.
* Copyright, registered trademark and that weird circle-e thing (I have _no idea_ what it is) has consistent face width.

### Alternative dice
`nonlatin-european` also has dice glyphs, for 1-6. If you want them to be see-through ("Black") or to use actual numbers rather than dots, visiting `altAssets` will provide these options. Just rename them to `nonlatin-european.png` prior to use, and if using the copy from PMC decompress the archive, into a separate directory within `resourcepacks`, discarding the archive in favour for using this work unpacked prior to tampering with it.
