# `ZZZ[Under construction]ZZZ`
Due to recent changes in this repository and their file locations, some things may not be accurate. I'll give a toss about fixing it shortly after I create new submissions in Planet Minecraft.

> _Heaps of redundancy to account for the `tl;dr` crowd. Sorry if this gets on your nerves but I would rather peple be angry att my writing than angry about not being able to use my mods effectively. may improve this readme in future._

# _Oooh_ shiny!
Seamless animated shimmering blocks? Yes please! This resource pack provides — in no uncertain terms — one of the most complex "Vanilla" style mods ever conceived… at least by me, thus far.

Basing itself on Stridey's directional lodestone as a block which has separate textures for different faces, this takes that idea a step further by using _animated_ textures.

The animation begins in the northwest side and stops at the southeast side. It looks a little funny seeing it at odd angles, but generally it should look great when facing either north or west, and alright if facing south or east.

# Packs
There are three resource packs (so far) which provides the advertised features on Planet Minecraft, and here in this repository. While the compressed archives are _not_ here, they do exist on Planet Minecrft. Below is a table of each:

> _Apologies for weirdness in the Planet Minecraft URIs, I tried to rush by rotating through multiple **new** submissions in tandem rather than drafting new projects and well… that weirdness happened. I didn't feel like destroying my drafts and starting anew after so long of screwing around with that **absolute dumpster fire** of a website. No offense to PMC users, but the service has quirks unfitting of a website representing Minecraft community creativity and unbeholden of a "Modern" website to have.`[/rant]`_

# Installation
### Block types
#### Ores
There are two packs providing ores. The **_non_-3D** pack is just the animated texture on each block. The **3D** pack uses highly modified copies of MrJoshuaT's 3D ores along with the shimmering texture to provide something that little bit extra while mining to make the experience a little less flat.
#### Blocks
There is only one pack which provides this, so installing this should be relatively simple.

### From Planet Minecraft
Just download the `.zip` file and place in your profile's resource packs. This is likely how you're going to do it.

### From GitHub
Place directories for respective packs in the profile's resource packs directory, either as real files or as symbolic links from local repository location.
